1. Demo1 - Detected faces,eyes,mouth using multiple haar cascades simultaneously.

2. Demo2 - Experiment with hiding face part or whole face using a paper.

3. Demo3 - Profile face detection using haar and lbp cascades simultaneously.

4. Demo4 - Profile face can only be detected for persons looking towards their right.
	   So for images where person is looking to his left, I flipped the image and shifted the reactangles for such frames.
